# Capstone Project: Predicting ground-state energies of molecules using Boosted Gradient Trees 

### Executive Summary

 Quantum Mechanics is the most stringently tested and successful physical model humanity has derived.  Born in the 1920s,  one of it's first triumphs was calculating the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom.  From a mathematical standpoint this amounted to an eigenvalue problem with linear differential equation for an operator that allows for a closed form solution.  However for most real atomic systems it is mathematically impossible to find an exact solution.  Once we go beyond the hydrogen atom, we are dealing with N-body systems that are described by highly nonlinear partial differential equations.  So equations can rarely be solved for exactly, and so must be approximated with a suit of numerical techniques.  Over the decades Physicists, Mathematicians, and Chemists  have developed techniques for approximating the energy spectrum of atoms and molecules. Many of these methods have only become practical recently with the explosion of computer performance.  
	For this project I have decided to apply the Machine Learning algorithms we have learned in the Data Science Immersive course to see how well we can predict the lowest energy state of a molecule without invoking any physics. The data consists of a data frame with 16242 rows and 1277 columns.  Each row represents a unique molecule that contains the elements
